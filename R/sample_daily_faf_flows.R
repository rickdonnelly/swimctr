#' Sample daily FAF flows from annual truckload equivalents
#'
#' @param annual_faf_flows Tibble containing annual FAF truckload equivalents
#' @param external_targets Tibble containing the target entry and exit truck
#'   volumes at the FAF external zones
#' @param internal_faf_region A list of the FAF regions included within the SWIM
#'   halo, defaults to 411 (Oregon portion of Portland MSA), 419 (remainder of
#'   Oregon), and 532 (Washington portion of Portland MSA).
#' @param daily_scaling_factor Real number the specifies the proportion of FAF
#'   annual truckload trips that will occur on the simulation day, defaults to
#'   calibrated value that best reproduces 2020 observed flows
#'
#' @details This function samples daily FAF truck trips from the previously
#'   created annual FAF truckload equivalents. The user will specify the truck
#'   volumes at each SWIM external station, which will constrain the sampled
#'   annual flows. A separate user-defined value must be supplied by the user to
#'   sample the annual internal flows.
