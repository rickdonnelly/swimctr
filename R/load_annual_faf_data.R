#' Load preformatted and processed FAF data for the target year
#'
#' @param preprocessed_faf Data frame containing the FAF inter-regional flow
#'  database previous extracted for modeled area and in format required by CT
#'  modules
#' @param target_year The four-digit simulation year as an integer value
#' @param interpolate A boolean variable denoting whether values for the
#'   `target_year` should be interpolated between the two closest years if it is
#'   not one of the years included in the FAF database (defaults to FALSE,
#'   currently ignored)
#' @param value_deflator An optional factor used to deflate the values in the 
#'   FAF, which are in constant base year dollars (2017 in FAF 5.x), to the 2009
#'   base year in the SWIM2 system. The default value is 1.0, which does no
#'   factoring.
#'
#' @details This function retrieves FAF regional flow data for a specific year
#'   from data already preprocessed from the original format distributed by
#'   FHWA. This conversion is usually done only once per FAF version and then
#'   stored as static inputs to the SWIM2 system. These preprocessed data are
#'   typically built using the `prebuild_faf_multiyear.rmd` program in the
#'   `data-raw` folder of the `swimctr` package. When used in a CT run within
#'   this module obviates the need to run the `swimctr::preprocess_faf_database`
#'   module, saving consider CT run time for each simulation year.
