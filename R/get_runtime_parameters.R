#' Read the runtime parameters file and store them in environment
#'
#' @param properties_FN Filename containing the runtime parameters, with full
#'   path information included in the filename
#' @param file_format The format the runtime parameters are stored in within the
#'   file, which includes 'simple' (the default, and currently only supported
#'   format) and hypertext formats in the future
#' @param delimiter The character used to separate the parameter name from its
#'   value (defaults to '=', not relevant for XML format)
#'
#' @details This function reads a file containing the runtime parameters
#'   required by the CT platform. The variables required depend somewhat upon
#'   the exact model implementation (i.e., what CT functions are called, using
#'   what methods, and in what order). These should be specified by the model
#'   developer. Note that it is possible to call this function multiple times in
#'   order to set default parameters the first time through, and scenario- or
#'   run-specific parameters later. In that case, earlier parameters are
#'   overwritten if also defined in files read later. This enables the latter to
#'   only contain parameter values that differ from one model run to the next,
#'   rather than repeating standard parameters that rarely change, if ever,
#'   between different simulations.
#'
#'   A token name can be included in one or more value fields by enclosing it
#'   between percent signs. For example, the `t.year` parameters could be
#'   included in the value `results_%t.year%.csv`. All of the token substitution
#'   is carried out before the token-value pairs are placed in global runtime
#'   environment.
#'
#' @returns This function creates a RTP environment that is subsequently accessed by
#'   all CT functions during a model run. The function returns a string that
#'   reports the tokens and their corresponding values. The user can ignore the
#'   results by calling the function with reading the results into a variable.
