#' Added weighted distances to FAF 5.x+ data without it
#'
#' @param fhwa_db A FAF regional database
#' @param distances A tibble containing intra-regional weighted distances
#'   (`wgt_dist`) by `dms_orig` and `dms_dest` pairs
#' @param internal_regions A list of FAF regions within the SWIM2 modeled area
#'   (defaults to FAF regions 411 [Portland] and 419 [rest of Oregon])
#' @param ignore_regions A list of FAF regions that will be ignored if weighted
#'   distances are not found in the data (defaults to currently defined FAF 
#'   regions in Hawaii, which are not reachable by surface transport modes)
#'
#' @details This appends weighted distances from an exogenously produced file of
#'   FAF region interchanges. The `distances` tibble or file is assumed to 
#'   contain only those fields (i.e., `dms_orig`, `dms_dest`, `wgt_dist`). This
#'   tibble is joined to the FAF regional database records, and the resulting
#'   tibble (the original FAF regional database plus the new `wgt_dist` field)
#'   saved for later use. If an interchange is present in `fhwa_db` that is not
#'   found in `distances` the program crashes. In that case the user will need to
#'   add the missing interchanges to `distances` before continuing.
